# alternateScoreboard
alternate design which lets user choose which game score he wants to see, the idea behind this was to use jquery to add and remove scores and images when user click on image of teams score he wishes to see.  the product is not finished and I was in the process of adding pitcher images to appear when user clicks on team icon.
